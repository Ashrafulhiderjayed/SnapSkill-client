## Project  Name - SUMMER PHOTO CAMP


## Project Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive website for summer photo camp classes, featuring a user-friendly registration and login system. The website will offer a variety of photography classes taught by instructors, with a responsive navbar and footer present on all pages except the 404 page. The homepage will showcase sliders, popular classes, popular instructors, and an additional attractive section with animation effects. Separate dashboards will be provided for students, instructors, and admins, allowing them to manage their classes, bookings, and payments. The admin dashboard will include features such as class management, user management, and the ability to approve or deny classes with feedback. Overall, the website will provide a seamless and engaging experience for users seeking to learn and teach online.


## The website has the following features:
* Registration and Login System: Users can create accounts and log in using their email and password or social login. The registration process collects necessary user information.

* Responsive Navbar and Footer: The website maintains a consistent navbar and footer across all pages (except 404 page), providing easy navigation and access to important sections.

* Instructor and Class Listings: The website displays a list of instructors, including their images, names, email addresses, and the classes they teach. Similarly, the classes page showcases approved classes with relevant details such as images, names, instructors, available seats, and prices.

* User Profile and Dashboard: Each user has a profile that includes a profile picture. The dashboard provides a personalized experience for students, instructors, and admins, allowing them to manage their classes, bookings, payments, and other relevant information.

* Class Selection and Booking: Students can select and book classes based on availability. The system ensures that only logged-in users can proceed with class selection. The availability of seats is reflected, and the class card changes color if no seats are available.

* Payment Processing: A payment system is integrated to facilitate secure and convenient payment processing for students. After successful payment, class availability is updated, and the enrolled classes are displayed in the student's dashboard.

* Admin Features: The admin dashboard offers functionalities such as class management, user management, approval or denial of classes, and providing feedback to instructors. Admins can also promote users to instructor or admin roles.
